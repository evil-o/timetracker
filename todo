None for now.

## Unit tests

-   various ways of entering time for log entries: "2" (hours), ":10" (minutes), "1:23" (hh:mm), ":90" (minutes)

## Setup

-   setup eslint + some basic code formatting rules
    -   property decorators on a separate line
-   commitizen + commit linting
-   faker for Cypress specs
-   setup github action cache

## Refactoring & Maintenance

-   Create a proper view state + input/output data flow for the day component
-   enable router input binding
-   Add a quick way to output a daily message
-   Custom 404 page to better solve the redirects (use a query parameter, let the app understand it and reroute)
-   Unify ngx bootstrap vs. @ng-bootstrap use
-   split dialog out of acitvities component into its own component
-   make each state have its own incremental migration action rather than listening to the one from storageVersion
